A program which stores fictional log messages on a system log. The program comes with 10 preloaded log messages and up to 10 more can be added for a maximum of 20 log messages
at any given time. Log messages can also be removed.

A log message contains a machine ID and a description, separated by a colon (:).

This program lets the user:
  - Search for and remove all messages which have a certain machine ID
  - Search for and remove all messages containing a keyword in the description
  - Add a new log message from scratch
  - Add a new log message by entering a machine ID and then randomly generating a description for that machine ID
  - Count the number of descriptions that exist for a certain machine ID
